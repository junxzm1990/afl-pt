This is the GNU cpio package
============================

* Introduction
==============

GNU cpio copies files between archives and directories.  It supports
the following archive formats: old binary cpio, old portable cpio, SVR4
cpio with and without checksum, HP cpio, and various tar formats.

This file contains brief information about configuring and compiling
GNU cpio.  It is *not* intended as a replacement for the documentation,
and is provided as a brief reference only.

The complete documentation for GNU cpio is available in the subdirectory
doc.  To read it without installing the package run `info -f doc/cpio.info',
or `man ./doc/cpio.1'.

The documentation in various formats is also available online at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/cpio/manual/>.

* Building

A usual three-stage procedure applies:

 ./configure
 make
 make install

See the file INSTALL for generic options to ./configure.

* Bug reporting.

Please send bug reports and suggestions to <bug-cpio@gnu.org>.
